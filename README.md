A study of tweets and their correlation to delays in public transportation

The data being used for this study comes from several places:
<ol>
<li>Metro Daily Disruption Reports, 04/30/12 - 09/08/15 from <a href="http://www.wmata.com/rail/service_reports/viewReportArchive.cfm">WMATA Daily Service Reports Archive</a></li>
<li>Twitter searches to collect tweets containing relevant keywords and usernames.  I used the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter REST API</a> via the <a href="https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython">Twython</a> wrapper.
</ol>
